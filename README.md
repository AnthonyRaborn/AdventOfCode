# Advent Of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 
People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

The main Advent of Code website is https://adventofcode.com.

# Advent of Code challenges using R

The solutions are not necessarily the best or the fastest, but I attempt to use as much base functionality as possible to demonstrate solutions to the puzzles.
